I'm a dedicated professional with an unwavering passion for programming. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm constantly seeking to improve and evolve, always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities.

While I admit to being a bit anxious and stressed at times, nothing beats the love and passion I have for my daily work, and I believe that's part of the growth and evolution process in my career. With 3 years of experience in the field, my current focus is on Typescript/NodeJS as a Backend Developer.
